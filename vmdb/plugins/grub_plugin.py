# Installing GRUB onto a disk image is a bit of a black art. I haven't
# found any good documentation for it. This plugin is written based on
# de-ciphering the build_openstack_image script. Here is an explanation
# of what I _THINK_ is happening.
#
# The crucial command is grub-install. It needs a ton of options to
# work correctly: see below in the code for the list, and the manpage
# for an explanation of what each of them means. We will be running
# grub-install in a chroot so that we use the version in the Debian
# version we're installing, rather than the host system, which might
# be any Debian version.
#
# To run grub-install in a chroot, we need to set up the chroot in
# various ways. Firstly, we need to tell grub-install which device
# file the image has. We can't just give it the image file itself,
# since it isn't inside the chroot, so instead we arrange to have a
# loop block device that covers the whole image file, and we bind
# mount /dev into the chroot so the device is available.
#
# grub-install seems to also require /proc and /sys so we bind mount
# those into the chroot as well.
#
# We install the UEFI version of GRUB, and for that we additionally
# bind mount the EFI partition in the image. Oh yeah, you MUST have
# one.
#
# We also make sure the right GRUB package is installed in the chroot,
# before we run grub-install.
#
# Further, there's some configuration tweaking we need to do. See the
# code. Don't ask me why they're necessary.
#
# For cleanliness, we also undo any bind mounts into the chroot. Don't
# want to leave them in case they cause trouble.
#
# Note that this is currently rather strongly assuming that UEFI and
# the amd64 (a.k.a. x86_64) architecture are being used. These should
# probably not be hardcoded. Patch welcome.

# To use this plugin: write steps to create a root filesystem, and an
# VFAT filesystem to be mounted as /boot/efi. Install Debian onto the
# root filesystem. Then install grub with a step like this:
#
#         - grub: uefi
#           root-fs: root-fs
#           root-part: root-part
#           efi-part: efi-part
#
# Here: root-fs is the tag for the root filesystem, root-part is the
# tag for the partition with the root filesystem, and efi-part is tag
# for the EFI partition.
#
# The grub step will take of the rest.
